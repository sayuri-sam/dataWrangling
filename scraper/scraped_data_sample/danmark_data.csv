"Long story short : green and perfect at the beginning (time horizon 1 year), realizing phase (1–2 years), feeling miserable (3–4 years), hating it and willing to get the f… out of the country before it completely drag you into deep depression (4 years), becoming one of them and accept living in a parallel old expat society (beyond 4–5 years). First time I got to Dk, someone told me : welcome in hell. Ironically I bumped into the same person in a chic boulangerie in Frederiksberg many years after. She was nothing but the shadow of once she was. It is easy to not get the message, knowing Dk is always quoted as being the place where people are supposedly the happiest in the world, everything is neat and clean, you can have a good job with a high salary and plenty of holidays and plenty of more bla bla bla. Well, anybody who spent some years in Denmark will have a highly different perception of the country. The majority will be deceived or for the remain 2% will have a (Danish) wife/husband, kids, and a magnificent ikea furnished apartment in one of the hipster neighborhoods, a Christiania bike with the kid inside (best is to jogg behind) and a bunch of locally brewed Mikkeler beers in the fridge (don’t forget the beard - it is a bit like in NY and resemble the Vikings, too). Do you fit ? perfect ! I also love the bicycle lanes. Thing is with Copenhagen, everybody is just doing the same. If you like this uniformity, everything smooth (don’t criticize !), nothing really happening, then you’ll be content. Danes are not happy. They are content. So you must be content too. But all this is nothing compared to the Danish mafia at work or in institutions, universities for example. In fact as an expat you are above all considered as a resource - you are not part of the tribe. Danes have a shared secret feeling of superiority on anything south of Rødby and west of Roskilde. Thing is they have internal (they would say ‘informal’) meetings between themselves, and you would only find out about the big strategic decisions afterwards during department meetings or at other occasions. Key positions are also chasse gardée for the Danes - unless you crawl on the floor, put a lot of effort learning Danish (you won’t, they don’t speak to you in Danish), and make extra unpaid hours to show your indefectible will to become one of them. How many times I saw ppl staying late while the Danes got home at 3–4 pm. Notice that their state of spirit is : you want to be here, you need to be like us - hum I mean my skin is shouting you otherwise .. Ok nice try then ! So moving out of Denmark is for many a way to escape poor career perspective and discrimination. I saw many friends leaving Denmark being half depressed and in search of a better life : geography, social life, career .. happiness ! Don’t get me wrong : stay a couple of years, enjoy, but don’t hesitate to leave when you hit the glass ceiling. You will certainly feel it coming, because it hurts so much."
"Lonely Depressive Isolated you can get to dancing clubs, and walk in the park and see a fawn, enjoy the safety, and go to an archers club. But you end up doing nothing, feeling nostalgic for the place you ran away from. We are tolerated and that thing gets under your skin. Like being the side piece of this wonderful awesome man, it gnaws at your self worth and identity."
"It is easy if you are an English speaker. This my 10th year in Denmark and I love it (apart from the weather!) I can get by in Danish but find that when I use my, quite frankly, badly pronounced Danish, people often reply in English! I accept that I am a foreigner and enjoy the benefits of being treated as such. People are invariably helpful and polite. Everyday life is easy but I am a white, middle class, well-educated Englishman, how it would be for someone of a different race who cannot speak English I cannot say, but expect it could be more challenging. Sometimes Danes can be condescending because they believe that Denmark is the best country in the world. Having travelled extensively I tend to agree"
"I've been living in Denmark for 13 1/2 years now and enjoy it. Once you get to know them, Danes are kind, gentle, loyal people. Getting to know them takes awhile, and to people they do not know, Danes can be closed and sometimes rude.  Danes talk to their friends.  They don't talk to strangers.  Also, because Denmark is such a homogenous society, there are a lot of unwritten rules that foreigners can't help but break. People nod their heads and smile at me a lot when I am breaking some unwritten rule. On the other hand, sometimes being a foreigner is a good excuse to break an annoying rule, lik… (more)"
"First off, a quick introduction: I was born in California and lived there for the first 16 years of my life, but my mum is Danish, which means that by Danish law, I am a citizen and have equal rights as someone who was born in the DK, but as a person who spoke barely any Danish and had no paperwork aside from my Passport connected with the Danish government when I arrived, I know many of the experiences of being a foreigner here, and people usually treat me as a foreigner. First off, as a foreigner, you either learn the language or you don't, and that affects how people view you. Well, that is,… (more)"
"I emigrated from California in 1991 at age 49 and I’m still there. I moved after being head hunted for a job, never expecting to stay forever. It took several years to discover my preference for Danish society, politics and cultural values. Denmark is an “us” society where sharing is the core value. Everybody who works gets a share of the national wealth through a redistribution of resources, brilliantly managed through their system of taxation. Income tax is extremely high but all citizens get “refunds” by way of “free” education, “free” health care including surgeries and hospitalization, su… (more)"
"Hi, I will not give You answer about Copenhagen, I’ve been there only once as a tourist, but in my experience with other parts of Denmark, I could say that Danes are really nice and open minded people. Of course, there are some sterotypes about foreigners, but in most cases Danes are joking about them, not taking them too seriously. I met great people in Denmark, got a lot of help and heartiness. Also, almost 100% of Danes speak english, so it makes it super easy to communicate, until You learn the language. I cannot literally say one bad thing about being here. Maybe they are kind of hermetic … (more)"
"Norway is really expensive. Norwegians think Sweden is cheap, no foreigner thinks that. Denmark is on most things slightly cheaper than Sweden, depending on currency rates.Norwegians are smug about their nature and oil fund; Swedes are smug about their global companies and organized society; Danes don’t really care, they just enjoy themselves.Denmark is tiny if you don’t count Greenland; Sweden is massive but no one lives in the north; Norway is in between but they’ve got the fjords, so they are happy anyway.In Norway, you can buy alcohol at Vinmonopolet (wine monopoly, beer is available in re… (more)"
"I think Denmark is a great place to live. It has a high standard of living, a strong social safety net, and a beautiful natural environment. The people are also very friendly and welcoming.

"I live in Norway, I have never really lived in Sweden or Denmark before. A lot of people from my country, India prefer living in Sweden over Denmark or Norway. But, I have visited Sweden twice and Denmark once. So here are the differences I found between the places-:Roads- Norway has no flat roads at all. Everywhere I go it is a slope, I find cycling so hard here because it is so slopy everywhere. I sometimes get tired easily even while walking especially during winters considering the high altitudes. I am going to the gym to improve my stamina for this reason. Sweden is a mix of slopes and fl… (more)"
On visiting Denmark we stopped in a restaurant for a smogesboard which included a shot of liquor. We asked our server if we could buy the imprinted shot glass to keep as a souvenir. He said no we couldn't have them he would bring us clean ones to keep no charge. That was what it was like in Denmark.
"It’s a beautiful country with beautiful people. Learning Danish language helps a lot. To get integrated it’s also very good idea to participate in many social activities and do volunteer work. It’s very safe, female friendly, child friendly, gender equality based and non-corrupt country."
"Just terrible. We get rain. The busses and trains can sometimes be 2 or 3 minutes late. The shops are full of wonderful things with which to tempt us into wasting money. People are so stupid they cycle instead of owning a motor car. Our food is so poor that despite having enough money to eat too much very few people are obese. People are so relaxed that we need a welfare state to support us. And then so simple that despite the welfare state very few are unemployed. People read books, newspapers and have opinions. What could be worse?"
"I'll try to note some things down:- The weather is not the best, there are a lot of rainy days throughout the year, but that's how it is, so we try to think of nicer things- Education is free (students are payed by the state to study), healthcare is free (except the dentists) which is definitely a big thing for the high life standard- Gender equality is in general in Scandinavia higher than in the rest of the world. Women open their own door, men have paternity leave and so on. Even so there is still plenty of sexism around and we're trying to get rid of it.- There is also racism, clearly … (more)"
