"I am happy that it works out for a some foreigners here but my life as a Kenyan girl living in Helsinki because of marriage with a Finnish man is totally different. If you want to read more about coming and living in Finland because of love, I recommend the book for both man and woman: How to Marry a Finnish Girl, everything you want to know about Finland and the Finns won’t tell you. I lived in Helsinki for 2 years between 2014–2015 because of my last marriage with a Finnish man. We were in a long distance relationship but we wanted to make it work. It was much easier for my ex-husband (let’s call him Mikko, which is not his real name) to have a job in Finland than in Kenya. He also warned me that it would not be easy for me to find a job in Finland, I was ready to give up the relationship because I didn’t want to live on the social benefit of being his wife (I had a nice job in Kenya at that time and wanted to be financially independent). But I loved him and I decided to move to Finland thinking I will be able to find a job if I try hard enough. We got married in Kenya and I received my resident permit based on family ties after 5 months of waiting. In those 5 months, I was learning Finnish, I sent job applications to Finnish companies and NGOs. I didn’t get any reply but I knew it was because I was still in Kenya. When the resident permit came, I quit my job and flew to Helsinki in July 2014. Finnish summer is really nice. The day is very long and weather is good most of the time. The temperature was actually quite similar to what we had back in Kenya in August. Everything was clean, tidy, organized, people on the streets looked happy. In my job back Kenya, I worked with volunteers from all over the world but I had never lived abroad before. I liked Finland for how developed it is, I met Mikko’s family and friends who were really polite and nice to me. I kept on with job hunting and went to language center to learn Finnish (there was not much else I was able to do anyway because money). Mikko finished his summer holiday and went back to work. So I was mostly alone at home. I was trying so hard to adapt to this society for 2 years. And now I will point out some tough aspects.Everything works! You drink water from the tap, it is cleaner than bottled water. Food is expensive and there is not so many options but it is very safe and of good quality. Restaurants are expensive but we also have really expensive ones back in Kenya. Buses, trams, metros and trains are mostly on time! High speed wifi everywhere, you pay with cards everywhere, you get free stuff everywhere: education, library, public hospital, museums even have free entry days. (High level education for people outside EEA countries are not free anymore from 2017)The Finnish weather in winter is actually the easiest one to handle. It was very hard to get up at dark and to go home in dark but you get used to it. I also had to learn to walk in the snow without falling. When it is minus 20 degrees and there is snow storm, it actually hurts when the snow/ice hit your face. But you wear so many layers that falling doesn’t hurt that much and there is heating also in the public transportation which is also usually on time!Finnish language was very hard. Some of my classmates were asylum seekers and they started to work in supermarkets, restaurants or in cleaning jobs, they didn’t need to speak that much Finnish. But I had master’s degree and I wanted to find job that was suitable for my education. Soon I realized that it is almost impossible to learn Finnish to a professional working proficiency as a foreigner even if you try for 5 years.English is spoken everywhere. Even homeless drunken people on the street (really no offence to them). However almost all official documents are still in Finnish or Swedish. Bills, contracts, service pages on internet. But with google translator and my effort in learning Finnish, I was able to manage.Finnish people are nice but it is hard to really become friends with them. Most of Mikko’s friends and their girl friends/wives are Finns. They were really nice to me when we hang out all together. But I didn’t become true friends with any of the girls in that circle. I had coffees with them and invited them to visit our place. But there was always distance because you don’t really talk about very personal stuff with them.Finnish people are very independent, maybe too independent. Back in Kenya, you know your neighbors and you have some friends who are just like your family. Kids on the same street know each other. But in Helsinki, especially in the city, you don’t even know your neighbor's name. You won’t expect any neighbor to knock on your door to borrow salt or watch your kid for an hour and you are not supposed to do so either. Mikko doesn’t even see his family very often. Maybe 3–4 times a year visiting his parents.“Unspoken discrimination” in finding a job. I didn’t need a work permit to work here as I married a Finn. But otherwise as a foreigner who didn’t graduate here, the employer need to prove to the economic office that there is no Finnish person can take this job - they posted the job opportunity for at least 2 weeks and no Finnish people who is qualified applied. Unless you are a programmer or a person who speaks a language that the Finnish company really needs for international sales, otherwise it is very difficult to find job that is equivalent for your education. I changed my last name to Mikko’s just to increase the chance that my CV was read but still not even an interview. My previous experience of working with international volunteers and effort of trying to learn Finnish didn’t seem to be relevant.There was not a good Kenyan community and I don’t know about other nationalities. There are not many Kenyans living in Finland- not even a Kenyan embassy. The nearest one is in Sweden. The Somalian and Nigerian community is much bigger but they are quite closed as well. I felt very lonely all the time because I only had Mikko and no one else close to me in Finland and I was home most of the times.My friends circle is pretty depressing. I became friends mainly with other foreigners from language classes, those girls who came to Finland for love. Many of them are without a job, or working in some NGO without pay. Some of them are still learning Finnish to try to find a job even that they want to go back to their own countries after their divorce. They stay here because they have kids with the Finnish man and the Finnish man wouldn’t let them taking the kids back to their own countries. My friend circle is full of sob stories about failed marriages, struggles fighting for divorce and custody of the kids and on-going job hunting.Marriage with a Finnish man was different than I thought. When we met in Kenya, probably under the African wind, Mikko was very cheerful, happy and warm to me. During the long distance relationship, because both of us were working and don’t get to see each other, we still had the passion and sparks whenever we were on skype. But married life was very different than from a long distance relationship especially because I was jobless and without family and many friends here. Mikko is out of home at least 10 hours a day because of work. He also had his own things like gym, going out with friends and other hobbies so we still don’t spend that much time together because a Finnish husband will not alter his life style for you even if you are lonely. He is very understanding and supportive but you are still supposed to deal with it on your own. In the beginning I was full of hope and the marriage was still fresh. But soon the tough Finnish life took a toll on me. I started to feel depressed and feels I was becoming a different person. I also realized that even though Mikko was such a good listener and always said how much he wanted to make the marriage work, he is just not as expressive as I want him to be when comes to sharing emotions. We were really good together when we were both happy. But under tough times, Finnish men shut down their hearts and mouth, either avoid talking about feelings or just burst out in anger sometimes. It was not the marriage I wanted.The marriage and relationship with a Finnish men is totally a different story. But it ended and I moved back to Kenya in September 2015. My old employer offered me a job and I felt that my life is finally back on track again. I don’t know if I regret the twos of living in Finland. In the end I did like the country and this experience has taught me a lot. But to move to Finland for love without a job, or to move to any other country, I won’t do again. I am very grateful that I didn’t start having children like some of my friends did just because there was nothing for me to do there. Otherwise I might have been still stuck in an unhappy marriage in Helsinki. It is my personal experience living in Helsinki, Finland. I did like the country. And I know that if I were able to find a meaningful job there, it would have been totally different experience. I wish all the foreigners in Helsinki happy and successful life and a lot of strength!"
"I’m a Swede who has been living in Helsinki for most of his life. Besides Helsinki I have also lived in Stockholm, so I’ll do some comparisons. This is gonna be a long answer, so in summary, Helsinki is a great city to live in. Below are the reasons why. 1. Helsinki is a really safe city. Finns outside Helsinki or even in Helsinki often see Helsinki as a really unsafe and scary place with lots of crime. But in factuality, compared to other big European cities the same size like Stockholm, Copenhagen, Amsterdam or Vienna, Helsinki is really safe. It has some bad neighbourhoods of course, particularly those in Eastern Helsinki, but it's nothing compared to other cities. I feel mostly safe walking outside at night, have never been a victim of a crime and this is the case for most Helsinkians. The scariest part about living in Helsinki might be the drunks, which I have sometimes seen as a threat but nothing major. There are no bombings or stabbings or robberies or mass rape like in other cities. I have to mention though that in recent years I have felt less safe. More unsafe things have happened in my neighbourhood, which has received many immigrants in recent years. And this is in West Helsinki, one of the better areas in Helsinki. 2. It's also really clean. Again, many Finns complain about Helsinki being dirty but it's really not, atleast when compared to other cities. Streets are quite clean with the occasional small trash here and there. Walls and doors are not covered in piss like in Paris. Areas smell great unlike in Stockholm. I think Finns are quite conscious about littering and it is very looked down upon. 3. The weather is a mess. One of the bad things about Helsinki is it's weird and unpredictable weather. In the summer it's meltingly hot and in the winter it's freezingly cold. It also often rains though it may abruptly start/stop. And it's also very slippery in winter, and many have gotten very serious injuries from it. So in the winter be very careful and don't run/bike. 4. There are no natural disasters. There are no earthquakes, no hurricanes, no storms. There is the occasional lighting. Apparently Helsinki does sometimes have earthquakes but they're really small and unnoticable with no damages. 5. It's bilingual. Many foreigners don't know that Finland actually has two official languages. Municipalities can choose which are it's official languages and in Helsinki they are Finnish and Swedish. 78% speak Finnish, 6% Swedish and the rest other languages. Everything in Helsinki is in both languages, with Finnish first. Every sign has Swedish, every government building, services, busses, many shops etc. And many workers are required to serve you in Swedish. 6. It also has other languages. 17% of the population hails from a foreign country, bringing in their language. You can increasingly find many signs and services in the most prominent immigrant languages of Estonian, Russian, Arabic and Somali. English is also almost always present. You can also occasionally find stuff in German or other languages. 7. Good libraries. Helsinki has free public libraries everywhere with lots of good stuff. They also offer lot's of books in foreign languages, like Chinese, French, German, Kurdish etc. 8. Reasonably good public transport. Helsinki has a tram, train, bus and metro system, city bikes, uber and an international airport. I'd say after Copenhagen and Amsterdam Helsinki is one of the most bike friendly cities in Europe. Helsinki also introduced city scooters which are now everywhere. Public transport is quite cheap, I think one month of bus use costs like 30€ and individual tickets around 2€. The connections are okay though lacking in some areas but you should be able to get by. Honestly compared to other cities it's good. And taxes are also quite affordable. 9. Rent is okay. Renting in Helsinki might be expensive or cheap depending on where you're coming from. It's definitely cheaper than in Paris, London, Stockholm or any US city, but probably more expensive than Eastern European cities. The apartments in the city centre are the most expensive ones. I suggest living a bit away from the city centre. You'll still get there easily with public transport or your car. 10. Education and healthcare is mosty free. Okay this is the case for all of Finland but felt the need to mention it here. For Finnish (and atleast Nordic citizens) education is free, from primary school to university. There are private schools which obviously cost but unlike in other countries they are quite rare. Healthcare is also mostly free or atleast affordable. You won't get bankrupt if you break your leg like in the US. 11. Food. Due to the relatively big immigrant population there are many international cuisines present in Finland. There are lots of them of them but the most common types are Indian, Chinese, Nepali, Japanese, Turkish, Italian, Greek and increasinly African. I think the selection is quite good, though perhaps not as great as other big multicultural cities like London. Supermarkets offer servicable ethnic food, mostly frozen.  Helsinki is also home to many international (american) fast food chains, like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Starbucks. Though don't skimp on the Finnish fast food chains, the most dominating ones being Hesburger and Kotipizza. If you're craving KFC just go to nearby Tallinn or Stockholm (Helsinki is supposed to get KFC in the future...) 12. Immigration. As said before the immigrant population is like 17%, much less than in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Oslo or Stockholm. But it's apparently increasing rapidly, and will reach 26% by 2035 in Helsinki, and 30% and 34% in the neighbouring Espoo and Vantaa respectively. And in some neighbourhoods the amount reaches 40%. This is creating a division and Helsinki is seeing similar trends like other cities where the immigrant population gets segregated, creating multitude of problems. 13. Nature. Helsinki is practically a city in the middle of nature. It's by the sea, and has great sea markets. It has many islands, forests nearby, parks etc. Helsinki is the perfect combination of nature and urban. 14. The people are liberal. The Green party is the largest party in Helsinki, that should tell you something. The people overall are very liberal, and all kinds of people are accepted. You don't really have to fear discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, race or sexuality. So in general I think Helsinki is a great place to live in (much better than Stockholm). There are many things to complain about but overall it's one of the best cities to live in in the world. Sorry if this was too long to read."
"I have been living here for nearly 3 years and love it. In the past few years I have lived in both Moscow and Tokyo along with Helsinki after leaving my hometown in New Zealand. I have taken the opportunity to travel around and check out other places, but as much as any one place may have some aspects that outweigh Helsinki (e.g. warm climate, lower cost of living, etc) as a package Helsinki is hard to beat. It is the same size population wise as the largest city in my home country but I would never consider living in that city yet love it here. There are many aspects which many replies mention… (more)"
"The point of view here is from an American expat who has lived in Helsinki for about 15 months. As a frame of reference I have lived in an American alpha city (New York) and some beta cities (Atlanta and Milwaukee). Comparatively speaking, Helsinki is clean, modern, cultured, upscale, safe, sophisticated, educated, technologically advanced, and is equipped with the level of public transportation (trains, trams, subways, buses and water taxis) that makes automobile ownership unnecessary. Such niceties, of course, come at a price. Helsinki housing is relatively expensive for its size (650,00 cit… (more)"

"As a Finn, let me comment. Some of these are Helsinki-specific, some more on general Finland level: In short: Everything just works in Finland, but to enjoy it, you’ll need to also make friends and that will likely require some extra effort, unless you’re willing to learn Finnish.People - Having lived in Austria and Sweden for some time, and having worked internationally for the last 6 years, I love it in Finns that they show who they are. People are open about their interests, things that made them happy, and what annoyed them. The kind of facade that one sees in some cultures doesn’t usually … (more)"
"I've had the opportunity to explore some of the most fascinating cities globally. But regarding Helsinki, a thing genuinely unique about this Nordic gem has captured my heart. Living in Helsinki is like being part of a secret club. It's a city that travelers often overlook, but those who venture here are rewarded with a unique blend of culture, design, and nature that's hard to find anywhere else.One of the first things you'll notice about Helsinki is the abundance of green spaces.

"You wake up to the alarm clock at 7:10 a.m. in the suburbs of Helsinki, in a house built in the 1960s.

You get up, wake up the children, and make yourself a cup of coffee and two sandwiches with cheese and tomatoes (it’s the time of the year when tomatoes are delicious and cheap), whole-grain rye.

"There are good sides and bad sides I would say. On one hand it is a modern city, it has a vibrant start up scene, it's on the sea, it is very safe, it has excellent public transportation, lots of nature around the city, it has a lot of young people and design related events. On the other hand the weather is quite bad for most of the year, the people is not very social, the nightlife is quite limited to the weekends and the local language is very difficult (also if basically everyone speaks English).

"I think it mostly depends where you live and work. Helsinki is geographically very large city. It can go over hour with public transport from one side to another.

You can have car of course that halves travel time but depending where you work you may not have parking for it. In that case, you propably spend lot of time travelling and are in hurry constantly.
