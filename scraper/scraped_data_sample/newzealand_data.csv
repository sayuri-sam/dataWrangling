"Have lived in both NZ and Australia for about equal timeframes. At present I live in Australia but work in New Zealand (commuting), kind of nullifying the saying that there are more and better jobs in Australia than New Zealand (not really my experience, but I suppose this depends on a lot of factors like your area of expertise and supply demand etc). My view is NZ has changed a lot in the last 10 years - it has become a LOT richer for one. It has outperformed almost all other major countries economically over the last 5 years, especially Australia, and it is starting to show. This is very different to the 1980–2010 period where Australia outperformed NZ almost every year . On the negative side, Auckland, the major city, has property prices on a par with Sydney, and I cannot make sense of this. Yes - Auckland is a nice place to live, but it doesn't warrant that level of property prices in my view. Something is seriously out of whack here. Healthcare and schooling are on a par with Australia. You'd be knit picking to split the difference. New Zealand places an enormous priority on education and health, as do Australia. New Zealand is safe, but not as safe as people think. It's comparable to Australia, although I think crimes of low level violence could be higher in NZ but I don't really know so don't quote me. All in all, both countries are safe. Jobs. If you are in the tech sector, and a good at what you do, there's an endless stream of work in New Zealand, most of it well paid by International standards. New Zealand has a growing tech sector and is well supported by government and private funding . Look at companies like Xero and a host of others that can never get enough staff. Getting skilled staff is a problem for NZ companies - they often have to import. Anything to do with building or construction you have guaranteed work with negative unemployment in NZ. NZ , due to housing and infrastructure shortages and plenty of cash, has a 10 year roadmap of massive construction programs so go figure - plenty of work. Basically, there's plenty of work in NZ, but you have to pick your industries. If you want to be a low skilled “web site designer”, well most NZ companies will have someone in the Phillipines to do that for a third of the price (moan moan about globalisation etc, but sorry, I'd personally much rather use someone in the Philippines for low end internet work than some grumpy kiwi with probably worse skills) so don't expect to Re qualify in some dead end role and pick up work - your skills need to be current and aligned to need like anywhere. Negatives . Gvt paid jobs in my view are underpaid. NZ Gvt pays a teacher with 7 years experience NZD80K per year salary - I think this is 10K - 15K off the mark and will start to result in education standards slipping, especially when industry non Gvt roles pay more or less international rates and the cost of living in places in NZ is “Sydney like” or worse. Politically, NZ is dim and naive and reactive. Gvts have an obsessive interest in promoting exports, which is not a bad thing as it has grown the economy, but they have not reinvested in areas like Teachers wages and doctors and nurses wages and this will start to bite soon. NZ refuse to pay road tolls , Gvt doesn't want to put them in, yet there is incessant moaning about the lack of infrastructure . Go figure. Infrastructure. The whole of Auckland and upper north island is a construction site with multiple large tunnel projects (including $3B underground rail), massive road projects etc. They are playing catch up here. All these projects make New Zealand hard to travel around, as there is constant traffic jams, diversions etc. Getting into and out of the main airport you are weaving around cranes, tunnels, and all sorts of construction and this is predicted to continue for 5–10 years. This is all well and good for construction , but it's a nightmare if you have to travel through it regularly . All comes down to NZ Gvt now has plenty to spend , and they are spending it, but they didn't spread the spend out through lack of planning so are trying to “build Rome in a day” which makes the country less pleasant to live. Overall infrastructure is BEHIND Australia, for example, but not by much now and in 10 years they will have caught up based on what I can see going on. I just drive from Sydney to Brisbane (Australia), and the road is a “single lane goat track” for large portions , so NZ is no different in terms of how it's major centres are connected . Combination of major highways, many still being built and widened , and two lane 1960s style windy roads that are “ear marked” for replacement when they can get the bulldozers and road construction equipment away from the Auckland expansion and Christchurch rebuild activity . People. I don't find much of a difference between your “average Aussie” and “average kiwi”. To the outsider , I can see why they think the two countries are the same. There is not much difference , if any, between the people in my view . They say NZers are “friendlier” - yea maybe, I don't know. Both seem reasonably friendly and pleasant - with the odd exception . One thing NZers have a bad habit of doing is blowing their own trumpets about how great NZ is when they are overseas. Seems like an inferiority complex to me. I always think “if it's that great, why don't you live there”. For me, value for money and lifestyle, Australia is better. Housing is cheaper outside Sydney, and even Sydney is no more expensive than Auckland but it is bigger and has the advantages of being bigger (more diversity of jobs, not...Access this answer and support the author as a Quora+ subscriberAccess all answers reserved by John Franks for Quora+ subscribersAccess exclusive answers from thousands more participating creators in Quora+Browse ad‑free and support creatorsStart free trialLearn more"
"This is a more or less copy of a previous answer to a similar question. First a list of the cons:We are remote from all forms of culture, except home grown which is second rate at best.Our comedy is terrible and usually not funny (never).Our home grown TV is worse.Food is expensive, as is housing, and most everything else.Wages are relatively low. You can't get away from the interminable drivel about cricket and rugby.A  news report of 20 million people killed by a planet busting meteor will  get third page while the cricket is headlined, just before (or after  depending on the time of yea… (more)"
"We have a country that is sufficiently far away from most the rest of the world that makes us interested observers. We work hard but are able to turn off the work mode fairly quickly, usually with a beer or some local wine. We have a centralised social health system so everyone is able to have access to healthcare. It's not perfect but most of us are quite proud of the system we have.  Employment opportunities are scarce in small towns but the cities offer good opportunities for professionals. We don't make quite as much on average than other western nations but our taxes are quite low by compar… (more)"
"I like it. How many people share an ancient land with an ancient people? You can lists pros and cons and be subjective. But no one has mentioned the FEELING of being here so far away from the madness. Were the sea air freshens a city of a million people so that you can be alone, beside the water, at 2 am in the central business district of the biggest city in NZ. Safely. No one mentions the spiritual aspect to the remoteness, the untouchedness, the freedom to be alone in nature by walking a few steps. The smell of the sea air. The clearness of the water. The stars! The stars are so bright. You can go… (more)"
"It has advantages and disadvantages and depends on what you want. New Zealand is either a blessing or a curse of opposites. Some points for me: Isolation is a blessing:Only those with a stomach for long flights care to come. The fastest flight time to get here from Europe is around 25 hours minimum, depending on stopovers. I do Paris-Doha-Auckland in a little over 25 hours. Other arrangements may take well over 30 hours in total. Australia is our closest neighbour and is a three hour flight away.Life is laid back and informal and things like scenery and beaches are free.Food and wine quality is… (more)"
"Lived down in Dunedin as a Scarfie for a semester (UOtago student). Kiwis are the nicest humans from any country I've met. I told a kiwi I met in Aussie last year, she said ""it's all we have"" referencing the small population and relative international obscurity.Following the All Blacks is more of a religion than sport. For a country of 4m people, they routinely kick the sh*t out of everyone else (good ol US of A not excepted). Re: employment. I've less experience here but my gauge is that knowing a trade helps a lot if you're international. Though I believe the minimum wage is pretty generous … (more)"
"There was an old man sitting in the arrivals lounge of Wellington Airport (Capital city of NZ). A traveler stepped off the afternoon flight from Sydney and asked the old man what New Zealand was like. ""Why, what is it like where you come from?"", replied the old man. ""Well, it was a dog-eat-dog society. Everyone was more worried about money than the people they worked with. There was rampant consumerism and the government never did anything to help."", said the traveler. ""What a pity"", said the old man. ""You will find it is much like that here."" Another traveler came off the plane a few minutes lat… (more)"
"It depends from where you're coming from & what you're looking for . I come from London, England & married a ""Kiwi"". Her daughters missed her being in NZ & although she loved being in the UK after a year or so We moved to NZ. It was one of the biggest cultural shocks I have ever experienced. It did not help that this born & bred ""townie"" ended up in a rural district 120 klms from lively Auckland.

Shops close at lunchtime Saturday even coming upto Christmas) pubs ( bars are more comman , … (more)"
"Heaven. I had the opportunity to live there (Auckland) for six months and I've been itching to get back ever since. Imagine endless opportunities to fill your spare time out in a pristine wilderness with fantastic weather, wonderful people, cheap prices, etc.  Heaven."
"New Zealand is very much like any first world country, with advantages and disadvantages. If you are well educated and have marketable skills life can be very good. In general public schooling is good and relatively inexpensive. The health system mostly works and there are social safety nets, Sporting opportunities are good in a limited range of sports. Housing in major centres can be expensive and New Zealand is not a high wage economy. Although race relations are fair some racism exists. Where New Zealand is special is its physical geography. It has a plethora of beautiful beaches and wilderne… (more)"
"Thanks for the A2A. Living in New Zealand is just like living in any other place. All places have good things and also some bad and ugly things. The good things about living in New Zealand that many of us take for granted are clean air, temperate, seasonal climate, political transparency, a fair judiciary, rule of law, and a functioning economy with a social safety net. We also have good roads and transportation systems. Still, we good do better in other areas. We have the third highest obesity rate in the world per population. We do also have problems with domestic abuse, drugs and alcohol abu… (more)"
"Well Auckland just another large city so leave that out. Other than Auckland mostly pretty laid back. Lots of nature, lots of quiet, lots of sheep, and 4 million people in a country the size of Britain. Farmers and hunters have guns but agonist no one else. We get on ok with our police who E really there to help. Our country is run by a kind and clever woman and we have universal Healthcare. This is fantastic"
"Pretty sweet in fact. In 2015 we were 11th in the OECD for education, our GDP is somewhat on the rise and the jobs are plentiful if you know where to look. The healthcare system is well balanced with ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) funding all injuries caused by accidents. Public hospitals in New Zealand offer treatment free of charge (similar to the NHS in the United Kingdom) but there does tend to be quite extensive, long waits for operations due to a waiting list system. More can be found here. Everything from the good old Sunday beach cricket game with the lads on the beach during su… (more)"

In saying that, there are still plenty of people in work, and we do have reasonable working conditions (although fairly low pay by Western standards.  Health care is fairly good - I have a very good doctor, and our hospitals are comparable with other countries. Everyone does have access to healthcare.
