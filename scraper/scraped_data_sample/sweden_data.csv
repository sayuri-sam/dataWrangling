"You are born. Your parents do not have to pay anything for the hospital visit.Up until you are in your mid teens your parents are paid for having you.All hospital visits are free for your entire life (except a small administrative fee for each visit; $15).Going to school is free of charge, even going to college and university (!)You are actually paid for going to school.Should you end up on the street, the social service finds you a secure home.People are nice, however not that talkative.If you are invited to visit at Swedish home you can expect to be offered a kanelbulle and coffee.Winters are cold, summers are nice, fall is beautiful, and spring is wonderful.We have two kings: Kung Carl Gustav and Zlatan Ibrahimovic."
"I can give you my unique perspective on these things, without presumptions. Lifestyle - Sweden is quiet. It’s the second biggest country by area in Europe, with only 10 million people. I live in Stockholm, about 12 minutes from the central station by train and it feels like I live in the countryside. If you sit on the subway, it’s quiet also. If you’re not proactive about making friends and acquaintances, you’ll feel lonely. You can meet these through your job, through a school, or through hobby clubs and interest areas. It took me a while to get used to the fact that you don’t generally strike up conversations with strangers on buses and trains. Salaries - I believe i get paid quite well for a 27 year old in a skilled area. I’ve worked in an advertising agency as a creative for the last three years. I earn enough to pay rent. I pay around 6000SEK from my mortgage every month. I can eat out without thinking too much about the cost. I save 20-25% of my monthly salary and splurge on the occasional crap i don’t need, like new shoes etc. Renting apartments in the city is quite expensive, but even when I first moved to Stockholm, I took a job at a restaurant as a cook and found that I got by just fine. My salary after tax was about 15,000SEK. Politics - For me this is a non-issue. Stockholm is a melting pot of cultures and in my five years here, i’ve never directly witnessed intentional racism.Sure, there are racists and sexist, but they’re everywhere. There is the odd story in the paper about rape, murder, assault, but they’re few and far between. I feel safe taking the train at 2am and my girlfriend feels the same way. Swedes are generally very accepting of people’s sexuality, gender identity, race, etc etc. Metal - The dads love it. My girlfriend’s dad loves Iron Maiden, Judas Priest etc, but people have diverse tastes in music. It’s not like you see a train full of metalheads everyday. Hope some of this personal perspective helps you. Come visit!"
"I have lived in Sweden back in 2015. As it was my first time outside India. There were many pros and cons.Pros:-1) Great environment,clean and fresh air. Which is definitely an issue in most of the cities in India.2) There is an environment of mutual respect at work place and most of the people are not bothered about what you are doing in your life unlike India.3) Travelling around Stockholm was so easy in metro and buses as you need a single card for 30 days ...cost 799 krones. It will work everywhere.4) So much learn from Sweden how to do governance and put a system in place. No room fo… (more)"
"There are, oddly, two schools of thought on this. Fox News version: I get up at 7, ignoring the call to morning prayer, since it’s basically my last chance before it becomes mandatory also for Christians. Turn on the news. Another 514 Christian women raped by refugees; the Chief of Police praises the new record and fires another 800 staff. Commuter train bombed by terrorists again; wife will have to walk to work, puts on her bulletproof vest (for the snipers). Kids off to school, after being robbed by the refugees who have set up camp in my yard; with any luck, they’ll just be paraded around the… (more)"
"To East Europeans like us, Sweden feels quiet, relaxed and laid-back. If you’ve ever been to the US, it’s a lot like Ohio :) That’s actually a valid comparison in light of the Swede’s love for All Things American. I’ve seen more classic American cars in the small town I live in, than in all TV shows together. Talks about the salary are not as meaningful in Sweden as they are in your Croatia or in my Romania. People are paid well, and even at the bottom of the ladder you should still get along quite fine. I don’t know much about Swedish politics, except there’s a more and more powerful anti-Muslim… (more)"
"If space aliens were to make a documentary on us humans, they might choose to film some scenes in Sweden to show what we are capable of as a species at best. It is a country of well-protected, great natural beauty where everyone shares quite equitably in the wealth generated by its fairly environmentally friendly and innovative industry. Life is relaxed, comfortable, and safe, and the beauty of the environment is mirrored by the beauty of the cities and the people, who really are exceptionally kind and caring. Sorry if this all sounds terribly corny. I am sure though the alien film industry would… (more)"
"That’s an interesting question. There is actually a government website, Statistics Sweden, and it tells us things like these: So, in Sweden, as of October 2019…7.1 % are unemployed, and 68.3% are employed; I am not sure what the rest are doing; perhaps they are still filling in the forms;93% of the population have internet access at home; those who don’t presumably use their neighbour’s wifi, or are waiting for internet to be installed;66% have a social media account; judging from my own experiences on Facebook, some of those are most likely fakes;consumer price index is 334.39 to 27.7, which i… (more)"
"It depends a lot on you and your character. No matter where you are in Sweden, you will not find the kind of diversity you can find in places like London, Paris, Berlin or Milan. Nor you will find the diversity in climate that you can find in countries like Spain, France or Italy. There are several things about Sweden that might make Sweden the right or the wrong place for you. If you don’t mind terrible weather, you appreciate nature and relatively homogeneous slow-paced environments then Sweden might be the right place for you. If dark, rainy and snowy winters don’t bother you, it’s going to b… (more)"
"It's Awesome!!! If you love nature, landscape full of green forest and lakes, you are going to fall in love with Sweden. This country offers you the highest quality of life. There is a reason why it is the top ranked country in the world in terms of living standards and happiness. It does sounds like a perfect country yet there are lots of widespread stereotype that may be intimidating. Its a cold country ! Sweden is a cold country and the people here are cold as well. True, if you are new or travelling for a short period of time, you will feel this coldness. Once you have spent some time in this… (more)"
"I moved to Sweden with my 3 children predominantly for financial reasons, as my Swedish husband earned more, and my work was quite flexible. At first I loved what I saw - free education, beautiful and abundant nature -even in the cities, well designed communities with plenty of free facilities, many free community activities and a strong commitment to sustainability. However after living here a few years I began to notice that some things are very wrong and Sweden is not the paradise it appears to be at first glance. Here is my list of the biggest issues as I see them:Firstly, there is no consu… (more)"
"Safe. Cold in the winter, wonderful in summer. Comfortable, with the basic minimum standard of most things being closer to the middle of most countries. Calm. All in all boring, in a very pleasant way. You can be left alone. People you don't know, like the bus driver, the waitress at the restaurant, the staff in the store, and the person next to ypu on the bus wanting to pass you - will not disturb you by forcing you into conversations with them. We do work hard and focus when we do, but the chatter level and privacy setting in society in general is very different from other places. Coming home to he… (more)"
"In numbers Sweden should be one of the best places to live in. And certainly Sweden is objectively better than 90% of the places in the world in material things. BUT, and that’s a big BUT, there’s a dark side to it - loneliness, seasonal depressions, boredom, lack of daily excitement. As a Swede I can corroborate that living here can be sometimes dull. It’s not if you live in Stockholm, but living in Jokkmokk or Torsby can be tiresome. Few things to do once you’ve gone nordic skiing 10 times, gone fishing 10 times, gone trekking 10 times, gone hunting 10 times and gone to the local MacDonald’s … (more)"
"Expensive and chilly, but overall, very pleasant, at least for a white English-speaker. The people are really friendly and the standard of living is very high. I live on a rocky island in the Baltic, and I have fiber-optic broadband to my home. The social services seem very good."
"Just an ordinary ""Svensson life"" Everything is arranged and secured from the moment you have been become, to the grave. You are taken care of everywhere. And everything is virtually free. At the maternity care center, you are checked that you develop normally. When you are born, you get your personal numbers which do enter you into society. You are queued to get your place in kindergarten, where you learn the language and how to live in a society. What rights you have (though not much about your obligations, even if they are few and simple. Actually, just one; not going against the stream, - so I … (more)"
