"I think it depends on each individual's personality, interests and preferences.Image Source: Pinterest But from my experience it is overall a great place to live in for the following reasons-:The country is very beautiful and is rich in natural beauty. It is mostly surrounded by nature.Has great public transportation system.I wouldn't say it is super clean, because I find some parts of Norway to be really dirty like central Oslo for instance but it is much cleaner than any other country I have been to especially of all the Scandinavian countries I find Norway to be the cleanest.People are mostly friendly, though I have encountered many rude and toxic people. 90% of the people I have come across have been really kind. Rude and toxic people exist everywhere on this planet.Is a bliss for introverts like me because most places are quiet and isolated. I love quiet and isolated places. Nobody approaches me, bothers me or interferes unnecessarily in my life. At the same time, there are some bustling, noisy places too and Norway has a very active social environment too.The society here is really great, the society is my favourite part of Norway. They value people's mental health and peace more than anything else. Most importantly the society is highly individualistic and it suits my individualistic personality perfectly.Everything here is very well-organized, regulated and functions in a very structured manner.Public libraries, oh my gosh ! There are public libraries in every street here and I am a big book worm. I live my life from library to library, they are completely free.I am the world’s most unathletic, unagile person and I have always been insecure about my lack of sporting abilities, inability to do workouts. But thankfully, Norway has a very athletic and sporty culture and everyone here is in some sport or the other. And nobody judges me for my unathleticism and people encourage me a lot. I am slowly getting better at sports by practicing every day.They have great coffee, great hot chocolate, great waffles and so many great social events, so many opportunities to pursue your interests and so many interest groups.Great work culture and working conditions, environment are great. Wages are good too."
"It’s pretty decent, but not perfect. Education all the way up through master’s degrees are free, while PhD students are salaried employees. Healthcare is almost free. Unemployment and sick leave benefits are exceptionally comfortable, many say too comfortable, with many having very little incentive to get a job. The rate of violent crime is low. Vacation days are many, and working hours short. Unemployment is low, though foreigners beware - not speaking Norwegian (or at least Swedish or Danish) is a major obstacle when applying for “good” jobs, as well as integrating socially, so please don’t just show up in our country and expect your life to immediately become wonderful. Gender equality isn’t 100 % (but no country has reached that, as far as I know), but it’s one of the better countries. LGBT conditions are generally good, especially in larger cities. It’s perfectly okay to be atheist, or to be religious, but a keyword here is respect - trying to convert someone, or make them live by your religious rules, will trigger hostility. Divorces are perfectly acceptable, as are having kids without marrying at all, or being a single parent. Certain subcultures, usually connected to religious groups or particular immigrant groups, will have a very different view on such things however. Traffic is very safe, despite our narrow, winding, bad roads. Perhaps because it is so slow. Slow rhymes with snow, which most of the country will get in generous amounts in the winter. Do get proper winter tires, not all-seasons. Do drive carefully on snow. Most people consider drunk driving entirely socially unacceptable, as does our criminal code: our limit is just 0.02 %, and we’ll happily take away your license for a long time, there are no “traffic safety classes and points on the license”, “getting let off with a warning”, “holding your alcohol well” or such - you blow into a tube, the number on the display is too high, you’re toast, without discussion. Speeding tickets are also fierce, and speed limits low - if our roads had been any good and new, safe cars less brutally taxed, you’d really have to make an effort to get yourself killed in Norwegian traffic. Nature is beautiful (foreigners say, I’m used to it and indifferent), and easily accessible, with a special law saying you can go pretty much anywhere (in the countryside, not gardens etc) and camp pretty much anywhere. To the Americans out there: Yes, guns are fully legal here, but we don’t do concealed/open carry in the streets. We use them at the range for sports shooting, or in the fields and forests for hunting. If you “need” one for self-defense, read some statistics, and if that doesn’t convince you, seek help from a mental health professional, who is available nearly free of charge.Of course, considering all the “free” services: Tax rates are high (though slightly lower than they used to be), with people getting taxed much harder than businesses. Certain goods (especially tobacco and alcohol) are very heavily taxed in an attempt to reduce their use. Prices of goods are generally high, especially food, with tariffs in place to protect inefficient Norwegian farms (it’s a chilly, mountaineous country, it’s not like our farms could even try to compete on equal terms with the flatter, warmer countries south of us), but that is mostly a problem for foreign tourists on foreign wages, Norwegian wages are sufficient to pay for Norwegian groceries. House prices, especially in the larger cities, are very high, with the prices in Oslo completely unhinged from reality. Roads outside the most heavily populated south-eastern region are often narrow and winding, and toll stations are frequent and expensive. Cars used to be crazy expensive, but that is also improving now, with electric cars and hybrids downright reasonably priced. Big cars with big engines are still outrageously expensive. The weather is chilly, wet and temperamental. You haven’t experienced real wind until you’ve been to our north-west coast in the fall and winter months (women, children and the elderly: remain indoors, or hang on tight to a lamppost or similar until you can be rescued. Do not go close to the sea to “watch the waves”, suddenly one of the freak waves will kill you, this happens regularly to foreigners). We’re not social creatures. Getting to know us is hard. Our English is good and we’ll answer your questions, but you’ll never truly be integrated into society until you speak our weird language, which is of little, if any, value in all other countries of the world. Of course, deeply down we’d love to be more social, but it takes alcohol. Lots of alcohol. Then we do stupid things, and the next day we pretend they didn’t happen. Not drinking gets you excluded, drinking gets you an STD."
"Most Norwegians prefer to stay in Norway, but for foreigners it is a mixed experience, and many leave again after a while. Some good things: -Norway is very peaceful, even compared to other European countries. There is little violence or threats of violence, and the country has not been at war locally since 1945. -There is a lot of unspoiled nature, starting near the cities. Pollution levels are very low almost everywhere in the country, and there are large areas where there is barely any sign of humans at all.-Public services are good. Rich and poor are treated much the same, and it is neve… (more)"
"It'll depend on your priorities. If you're a heat-seeking sun-worshipping lover of beaches, then most of Norway for most of the year will have nothing to offer you. The same is true if you're a big-city person who considers any city short of a million people to be lacking in cultural offerings. On most of the quantifiable metrics that are often used to measure quality of life, the Scandinavian coun… (more)"
"The weather can be a bit shabby. Not terrible, just shabby. Other than that, it’s one of the best countries in the World by most measures.Money: We’re the third richest country in the World after Luxembourg and Switzerland measured by GDP per capita. [1] We also have among the lowest rates of income inequality. [2] This means that although few Norwegians are super rich, practically everyone makes a good living. Poverty is nonexistent.Corruption: We’re in the top 10 countries in the World with the least corruption. [3]Natural disasters: We don’t have earthquakes or volcanoes worth mentioning.

"I have been living in Norway for quite some time and speak Norwegian at a native level. However, I’m not ethnic Norwegian. I will explain to you some basic reasons why Norway can be a good country to live in and some of why it’s not a good choice at all.Norway has affordable (NB! not completely free) healthcare of high quality. Norway has good educational institutions and good working conditions. Norway has high wages, pension, and other employment benefits.However...The social inequality and differences between native Norwegians and immigrants are becoming worse.If you have basic schooling fo… (more)"
"Yes, Norway is a very nice country to live in. It consistently ranks highly for quality of life, healthcare, education, and general happiness. Norway has a high standard of living and beautiful natural scenery, which is as beautiful as a painting. And Norwegian food is also unique. It is no exaggeration to say that I ate the most delicious salmon soup in the world here!          … (more)"
"I would have to go against the stream here and say it was, but it isn’t anymore. But I can understand that people who bought their house or flat 20 years ago thinks it is a fabulous place to live. But if you decide to migrate to Oslo you will quickly find that it isn’t. Here are the main problems. Salaries might look high at the first glance. Normal jobs pay around NOK 20–30000 per month. Good right? Depends on the cost really. An apartment in Oslo, 70–80 sqm, costs about 20000 NOK currently, smaller ones, 45–60 sqm, around 15000 NOK. That is a huge chunk of your net salary? And that is applicab… (more)"
"Is it a good idea to move to Norway? Norway, especially Oslo, is one of the most expensive places to live in in the world. At the same time, it is a highly industrialized and digitalized country, so there is a very limited need for unskilled labor. If you A - know the language and B - have a good education, then Norway is great. It is expensive, but it’s safe, with a stable economy, well functioning democracy with a strong state and rule of law and transparent governance. You need to learn the language Language skills cannot be overestimated. If you don’t know the langauge, you will have a hard tim… (more)"
"I will let my new photos speak for themselves, as I was out and about walking around on my island in Norway for 4 hours yesterday. I didn't cover much of the island as I walk like a snail but I believe I still got some great shots. I worked on this farm for free some years ago, I am on welfare disability but I enjoy nature so one day while I was out walking I saw the farmer out in the fields and I asked him if he wanted free help, so I ended up working for him 3 days a week chopping wood. I did this from May until September. He would stock up on firewood during summer then sell it during winter … (more)"
"Yes. For these reasons: Wherever you come from the income from working in Norway is likely to be comparable or higher than wherever you come from. Norwegians don’t interfere with you so long as you make an effort to fit in. This means that you can live pretty much however you like so long as it doesn’t affect other people. The social security and health systems are amongst the best in the world. The health system covers you the moment you land. Falling ill won’t bankrupt you, losing your job doesn’t mean losing your home. Working and paying tax as a resident of Norway gives you a right to a pension… (more)"
"I have lived in Norway for some seasons (seasons refer to winters and summers as considered in hotel industry field), but i have been on Norway before. I am fascinated and deeply passionated by wild unspoiled nature specially forests and mountains on the nordic latitudes. I don’t mind cold weather (as long as i’m wearing the right clothes) and i love the snow covered landscape, i love also hiking and skiing (cross country is free). I also love the summer there which is green and mild, (unlike the madness of hot weather in southern europe), and you can swim on clean clear waters of lakes. Norwe… (more)"
"I live in Oslo and I think it is a great place to live. But when I say that its a great place, how it is interpreted by some bothers me sometimes. For instance, “you must be lucky to be living in this paradise” or assumptions that I came here for a better life. Norwegians really think that any immigrant here is blessed by Norway. Fact is I came here to work with some people due to closeness of our ideas and I met my partner here so I think it makes it a good combination for me to stay here a while. Also, I am tired of moving around…it puts economic and most importantly stress on relationships.… (more)"
"Thanks for the A2A. I would have to say that yes, in my opinion it is a good country to live in. But just as other people already wrote, “good” is a very personal concept. If your goal is life balance (work/personal balance) then I haven’t met a better country. As long as you enjoy doing sports, being out in the mountain, solitude, SNOW and MORE SNOW, etc. If your goal is making lots of new friends, feeling part of the community, and overall getting rich (because you’ve been lied to and told that salaries in Norway are super high - which, by the way, they’re not), then no, it’s not a good place f… (more)"
