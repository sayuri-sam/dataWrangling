       "['You are born. Your parents do not have to pay anything for the hospital visit.Up until you are in your mid teens your parents are paid for having you.All hospital visits are free for your entire life (except a small administrative fee for each visit; $15).Going to school is free of charge, even going to college and university (!)You are actually paid for going to school.Should you end up on the street, the social service finds you a secure home.People are nice, however not that talkative.If you are invited to visit at Swedish home you can expect to be offered a kanelbulle and coffee.Winters are cold, summers are nice, fall is beautiful, and spring is wonderful.We have two kings: Kung Carl Gustav and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.',\n",
       " 'I can give you my unique perspective on these things, without presumptions. Lifestyle - Sweden is quiet. It’s the second biggest country by area in Europe, with only 10 million people. I live in Stockholm, about 12 minutes from the central station by train and it feels like I live in the countryside. If you sit on the subway, it’s quiet also. If you’re not proactive about making friends and acquaintances, you’ll feel lonely. You can meet these through your job, through a school, or through hobby clubs and interest areas. It took me a while to get used to the fact that you don’t generally strike up conversations with strangers on buses and trains. Salaries - I believe i get paid quite well for a 27 year old in a skilled area. I’ve worked in an advertising agency as a creative for the last three years. I earn enough to pay rent. I pay around 6000SEK from my mortgage every month. I can eat out without thinking too much about the cost. I save 20-25% of my monthly salary and splurge on the occasional crap i don’t need, like new shoes etc. Renting apartments in the city is quite expensive, but even when I first moved to Stockholm, I took a job at a restaurant as a cook and found that I got by just fine. My salary after tax was about 15,000SEK. Politics - For me this is a non-issue. Stockholm is a melting pot of cultures and in my five years here, i’ve never directly witnessed intentional racism.Sure, there are racists and sexist, but they’re everywhere. There is the odd story in the paper about rape, murder, assault, but they’re few and far between. I feel safe taking the train at 2am and my girlfriend feels the same way. Swedes are generally very accepting of people’s sexuality, gender identity, race, etc etc. Metal - The dads love it. My girlfriend’s dad loves Iron Maiden, Judas Priest etc, but people have diverse tastes in music. It’s not like you see a train full of metalheads everyday. Hope some of this personal perspective helps you. Come visit!',\n",
       " 'I have lived in Sweden back in 2015. As it was my first time outside India. There were many pros and cons.Pros:-1) Great environment,clean and fresh air. Which is definitely an issue in most of the cities in India.2) There is an environment of mutual respect at work place and most of the people are not bothered about what you are doing in your life unlike India.3) Travelling around Stockholm was so easy in metro and buses as you need a single card for 30 days ...cost 799 krones. It will work everywhere.4) So much learn from Sweden how to do governance and put a system in place. No room fo… (more)',\n",

       " 'I can give you my unique perspective on these things, without presumptions. Lifestyle - Sweden is quiet. It’s the second biggest country by area in Europe, with only 10 million people. I live in Stockholm, about 12 minutes from the central station by train and it feels like I live in the countryside. If you sit on the subway, it’s quiet also. If you’re not proactive about making friends and acquaintances, you’ll feel lonely. You can meet these through your job, through a school, or through hobby clubs and interest areas. It took me a while to get used to the fact that you don’t generally strike up conversations with strangers on buses and trains. Salaries - I believe i get paid quite well for a 27 year old in a skilled area. I’ve worked in an advertising agency as a creative for the last three years. I earn enough to pay rent. I pay around 6000SEK from my mortgage every month. I can eat out without thinking too much about the cost. I save 20-25% of my monthly salary and splurge on the occasional crap i don’t need, like new shoes etc. Renting apartments in the city is quite expensive, but even when I first moved to Stockholm, I took a job at a restaurant as a cook and found that I got by just fine. My salary after tax was about 15,000SEK. Politics - For me this is a non-issue. Stockholm is a melting pot of cultures and in my five years here, i’ve never directly witnessed intentional racism.Sure, there are racists and sexist, but they’re everywhere. There is the odd story in the paper about rape, murder, assault, but they’re few and far between. I feel safe taking the train at 2am and my girlfriend feels the same way. Swedes are generally very accepting of people’s sexuality, gender identity, race, etc etc. Metal - The dads love it. My girlfriend’s dad loves Iron Maiden, Judas Priest etc, but people have diverse tastes in music. It’s not like you see a train full of metalheads everyday. Hope some of this personal perspective helps you. Come visit!',\n",
